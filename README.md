# Project2
Spring Semester Final Project

Project Description
======
This is a tetris-like/block game where you try to click on blocks that are next to other blocks of the same color to get rid of them. 

Installation
======
1. Have Processing downloaded
2. Clone this repository to your computer
3. Open Processing and use it to open the reverseTetris file

Use
======
After opening the reverseTetris file through Processing, use Processing's play button to start the program. Afterwards, you will see some falling blocks. Blocks will pile up on top of the stationary white block layer and you lose when blocks reach the top level of the window. To get rid of the blocks, click on them when you see that they are arranged such that there are two in contact with each other that are the same color. The goal of the game is to last as long as you can without losing.
